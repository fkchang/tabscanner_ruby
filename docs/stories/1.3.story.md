# Story 1.3: Poll Result

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Ruby developer,
**I want** to poll the Tabscanner API for OCR processing results using a token,
**so that** I can retrieve parsed receipt data when processing is complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GET the `result` endpoint with the token
2. Retry if status is "processing" 
3. Raise error if failure
4. Return parsed receipt data as a Ruby hash
5. Method signature should be `Tabscanner.get_result(token, timeout: 15) => { data: {...} }`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create Result class for polling logic (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Create lib/tabscanner/result.rb file
  - [x] Implement GET request to {base_url}/result/{token} endpoint
  - [x] Parse JSON response and check status field
  - [x] Implement retry logic with 1s intervals for "processing" status
  - [x] Handle timeout after specified duration (default 15s)
  - [x] Raise appropriate errors for failure statuses
  - [x] Return parsed receipt data as Ruby hash on success
- [x] Integrate with existing Configuration system (AC: 1)
  - [x] Use config.api_key for authentication
  - [x] Use config.base_url for endpoint construction
  - [x] Use config.region if required by API
- [x] Update Client module interface (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add get_result method to Client module
  - [x] Delegate to Result class for actual polling
  - [x] Ensure proper require statements for new files
- [x] Update main module interface (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add get_result method to main Tabscanner module
  - [x] Ensure proper delegation to Client
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Test successful result retrieval with complete data
  - [x] Test retry logic for "processing" status responses
  - [x] Test timeout handling after specified duration
  - [x] Test error handling for failure statuses
  - [x] Test integration with configuration system
  - [x] Use VCR for recording HTTP interactions with polling scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion notes:
- Request class established for HTTP handling with Faraday
- Error hierarchy complete with UnauthorizedError, ValidationError, ServerError
- Client module provides clean delegation pattern
- Configuration system integrated with api_key, base_url, region
- VCR/WebMock configured for test mocking
- Project follows modular structure under lib/tabscanner/

### Module Structure
From architecture document [Source: architecture.md#module-structure]:
```
tabscanner/
├── client.rb          # ✅ Already implemented - needs get_result method
├── request.rb         # ✅ Already implemented  
├── result.rb          # THIS STORY - polling logic
├── config.rb          # ✅ Already implemented
├── errors/            # ✅ Already implemented
└── spec/              # Tests for this story
```

### Result Component Details
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#4-result]:
- Polls API for status updates using token
- Supports timeout and retry interval
- Returns parsed JSON

### API Integration Details
From PRD Feature 3 [Source: prd.md#3-poll-result]:
- GET the `result` endpoint with the token
- Retry if status is "processing"
- Raise error if failure  
- Return parsed receipt data as a Ruby hash
- Method: `Tabscanner.get_result(token, timeout: 15) => { data: {...} }`

### Performance Requirements
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#performance]:
- Expected OCR response time: 2-3s
- Polling every 1s, with max timeout of 15s

### Error Handling Requirements
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#5-errors] and PRD [Source: prd.md#4-error-handling]:
- Use existing error classes: UnauthorizedError (401), ValidationError (422), ServerError (500+)
- Base error class: `Tabscanner::Error`

### HTTP Adapter Requirements
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#http-adapter]:
- Use `Faraday` for HTTP requests (already available from Story 1.2)
- Faraday adapter easily swapped/mocked in tests

### File Locations
Based on project structure and previous story implementations:
- Result polling logic: `lib/tabscanner/result.rb`
- Update client interface: `lib/tabscanner/client.rb`
- Update main module: `lib/tabscanner.rb`
- Tests: `spec/result_spec.rb`, update `spec/client_spec.rb`, `spec/tabscanner_spec.rb`

### Expected Usage Pattern
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#deployment--usage]:
```ruby
Tabscanner.configure do |c|
  c.api_key = 'abc'
  c.region = 'us'
end

token = Tabscanner.submit_receipt('receipt.jpg')  # ✅ Already implemented
data = Tabscanner.get_result(token)               # THIS STORY
```

### Dependencies
From PRD [Source: prd.md#dependencies] and Story 1.2 implementation:
- `faraday` for HTTP client (already added to gemspec)
- `json` for parsing (already available)
- `rspec`, `vcr`, `webmock` already configured

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- `spec/result_spec.rb` - Test polling logic, retry behavior, timeout handling
- `spec/client_spec.rb` - Test get_result method delegation (update existing)
- `spec/tabscanner_spec.rb` - Test public interface integration (update existing)
- `spec/cassettes/` - VCR recordings for HTTP polling interactions

### Test Standards
From architecture and existing test patterns:
- Use RSpec for all tests
- Use VCR + WebMock for HTTP mocking
- Test coverage should include both success and error scenarios
- Follow existing test patterns from previous stories
- Use `--format documentation --coverage` for test runs

### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Test successful result retrieval when status is "complete"
- Test retry behavior when status is "processing" (multiple polling cycles)
- Test timeout handling when processing exceeds specified duration
- Test error responses (401, 422, 500+) and proper error class raising
- Test different result data formats and proper hash return
- Test integration with configuration system (api_key, base_url usage)
- Mock HTTP polling requests using VCR cassettes with realistic timing
