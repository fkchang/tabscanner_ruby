# Story 1.2: Submit Receipt

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Ruby developer,
**I want** to submit receipt images to the Tabscanner API,
**so that** I can initiate OCR processing and receive a token for later result retrieval.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Accept a local file path or IO stream as input
2. POST the image to the Tabscanner `process` endpoint using multipart form data
3. Return a token string on successful submission
4. Raise appropriate errors on API failures (401, 422, 500+)
5. Method signature should be `Tabscanner.submit_receipt(file_path_or_io) => 'token123'`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create Client module for public API interface (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add submit_receipt class method to Tabscanner module
  - [x] Delegate to Request class for actual HTTP handling
- [x] Implement Request class for HTTP handling (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Create lib/tabscanner/request.rb file
  - [x] Handle file path input by reading file content
  - [x] Handle IO stream input directly
  - [x] Build multipart form data with image file
  - [x] POST to {base_url}/process endpoint with proper headers
  - [x] Parse response and extract token
  - [x] Handle HTTP error responses with appropriate error classes
- [x] Integrate with existing Configuration system (AC: 2)
  - [x] Use config.api_key for authentication
  - [x] Use config.base_url for endpoint construction
  - [x] Use config.region if required by API
- [x] Update main module interface (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add submit_receipt method to main Tabscanner module
  - [x] Ensure proper require statements for new files
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Test file path input handling
  - [x] Test IO stream input handling
  - [x] Test successful token return
  - [x] Test error handling for different HTTP status codes
  - [x] Test integration with configuration system
  - [x] Use VCR for recording HTTP interactions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion notes:
- Configuration system uses singleton pattern with ENV defaults
- Error hierarchy established with base_error.rb, unauthorized_error.rb, validation_error.rb, server_error.rb
- Project follows modular structure under lib/tabscanner/
- Test files go in spec/ directory with RSpec framework

### Module Structure
From architecture document [Source: architecture.md#module-structure]:
```
tabscanner/
├── client.rb          # Central public interface (THIS STORY)
├── request.rb         # Handles multipart uploads (THIS STORY)
├── config.rb          # ✅ Already implemented
├── result.rb          # Future story
├── errors/            # ✅ Already implemented
└── spec/              # Tests for this story
```

### Client Component Details
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#2-client]:
- Central public interface
- Methods: `submit_receipt`, `get_result`
- Delegates to `Request` and `Result`

### Request Component Details
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#3-request]:
- Handles multipart form data for image uploads
- Manages headers and endpoint logic
- Raises wrapped errors on failure

### HTTP Adapter Requirements
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#http-adapter]:
- Use `Faraday` for simplicity and middleware support
- Faraday adapter easily swapped/mocked in tests

### API Integration Details
From PRD Feature 2 [Source: prd.md#2-submit-receipt]:
- Accept local file path or IO stream
- POST to Tabscanner `process` endpoint
- Return token or error
- Method: `Tabscanner.submit_receipt(file_path_or_io) => 'token123'`

### Error Handling Requirements
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#5-errors] and PRD [Source: prd.md#4-error-handling]:
- Use existing error classes: UnauthorizedError (401), ValidationError (422), ServerError (500+)
- Base error class: `Tabscanner::Error`

### File Locations
Based on project structure and Story 1.1 implementation:
- Main client interface: `lib/tabscanner/client.rb`
- HTTP request handler: `lib/tabscanner/request.rb`
- Update main module: `lib/tabscanner.rb`
- Tests: `spec/client_spec.rb`, `spec/request_spec.rb`

### Testing Requirements
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#testing]:
- **Framework:** RSpec
- **API mocking:** VCR + WebMock
- **Fixtures:** YAML/JSON responses from Tabscanner
- **Coverage:** RSpec `--format documentation --coverage`
- Test files go in `spec/` directory following RSpec conventions
- Use VCR cassettes for recording real HTTP interactions

### Dependencies
From PRD [Source: prd.md#dependencies]:
- `faraday` for HTTP client (need to add to gemspec)
- `json` for parsing
- `rspec`, `vcr`, `webmock` already configured in Story 1.1

### Expected Usage Pattern
From architecture [Source: architecture.md#deployment--usage]:
```ruby
Tabscanner.configure do |c|
  c.api_key = 'abc'
  c.region = 'us'
end

token = Tabscanner.submit_receipt('receipt.jpg')  # THIS STORY
data = Tabscanner.get_result(token)               # Future story
```

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- `spec/client_spec.rb` - Test public interface methods
- `spec/request_spec.rb` - Test HTTP request handling and multipart uploads
- `spec/cassettes/` - VCR recordings for HTTP interactions

### Test Standards
From architecture and Story 1.1 patterns:
- Use RSpec for all tests
- Use VCR + WebMock for HTTP mocking
- Test coverage should include both success and error scenarios
- Follow existing test patterns from config_spec.rb
- Use `--format documentation --coverage` for test runs

### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Test file path handling (valid files, invalid files, missing files)
- Test IO stream handling (StringIO, File IO objects)
- Test successful API responses with token return
- Test error responses (401, 422, 500+) and proper error class raising
- Test integration with configuration system (api_key, base_url usage)
- Mock HTTP requests using VCR cassettes
