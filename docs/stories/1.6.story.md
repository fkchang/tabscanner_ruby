# Story 1.6: Final Integration & Testing

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Ruby developer,
**I want** a fully tested and integrated Tabscanner gem,
**so that** I can confidently use it in production with >90% test coverage and complete functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Achieve >90% test coverage across all modules
2. Complete VCR cassettes for all HTTP interactions
3. Integration tests for full workflow (submit → poll → result)
4. Gem builds and installs without errors
5. All PRD success metrics met

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Complete test coverage analysis (AC: 1)
  - [x] Run coverage report
  - [x] Identify untested code paths
  - [x] Add missing unit tests
- [x] VCR cassette completion (AC: 2)
  - [x] Record all API interactions
  - [x] Test success and error scenarios
  - [x] Sanitize sensitive data
- [x] Integration testing (AC: 3)
  - [x] End-to-end workflow tests
  - [x] Real API integration tests
  - [x] Error scenario integration tests
- [x] Gem packaging verification (AC: 4)
  - [x] Test gem build process
  - [x] Verify installation from built gem
  - [x] Test in clean Ruby environment
- [x] PRD success metrics validation (AC: 5)
  - [x] Verify <10 line usage example works
  - [x] Confirm >90% test coverage
  - [x] Test Bundler installation

## Dev Notes

### From PRD Success Metrics
- Gem installs via Bundler with no errors
- Full round trip from file to parsed JSON in under 10 lines
- >90% test coverage (unit + integration)

### Integration Points
- Tests all functionality from Stories 1.1-1.5
- Validates complete gem functionality
- Prepares for production release
