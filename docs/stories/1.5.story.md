## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: Exceptional documentation that exceeds professional standards. The README is comprehensive, well-organized, and provides clear examples for every use case. The example scripts are clean, practical, and demonstrate real-world usage patterns.

**Strengths**:
- Complete documentation covering installation, configuration, usage, and error handling
- Professional README with clear structure and excellent formatting
- Working example scripts with proper error handling
- Meets PRD requirement of under 10 lines (7 functional lines)
- Real-world integration examples (Ruby on Rails)
- Comprehensive error handling documentation with specific scenarios
- Debug mode documentation with example output
- Complete API reference with method signatures and response formats

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was needed. The documentation and examples are well-written and follow best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Examples follow Ruby best practices with proper error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Examples placed correctly in examples/ directory with documentation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Example functionality verified through functional code
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and documented

### Improvements Checklist

All items completed during implementation:

- [x] Complete README with installation and usage examples (README.md)
- [x] Full round trip example from file to parsed JSON under 10 lines (examples/process_receipt.rb - 7 lines)
- [x] Error handling examples for all error types (README.md:239-362)
- [x] Configuration examples for different environments (README.md:84-112)
- [x] Working example scripts with verification (examples/process_receipt.rb, batch_process.rb, quick_test.rb)
- [x] Professional documentation with clear structure and formatting
- [x] Ruby on Rails integration examples (README.md:180-235)
- [x] Debug mode documentation with example output (README.md:364-397)
- [x] Complete API reference with method signatures (README.md:399-432)
- [x] Comprehensive examples directory with proper documentation

### Security Review

✓ **No security concerns identified**
- Example scripts properly handle environment variables for API keys
- No hardcoded credentials in documentation or examples
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- Debug examples show proper redaction of sensitive data

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Examples demonstrate performance best practices**
- Proper timeout handling in examples
- Batch processing example shows efficient error handling
- Retry logic example demonstrates exponential backoff
- Resource cleanup shown in file handling examples

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

This documentation represents professional-grade work that exceeds expectations. The README is comprehensive yet accessible, examples are practical and working, and all acceptance criteria are met with outstanding quality. The 7-line functional example successfully demonstrates the complete workflow from file to parsed JSON, meeting the PRD success metric of under 10 lines.
